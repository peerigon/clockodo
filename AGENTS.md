# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding assistants when working with code in this repository.

**Important**: You **must** follow [these rules](./node_modules/@peerigon/configs/ai/rules.mdc) and its language-specific rules referenced in that file.

## Keeping This File Updated

When you make changes to the project that affect how AI agents should work with the codebase, update this file accordingly. This includes changes to:

- Overall folder structure
- Tech stack (frameworks, libraries, languages)
- npm scripts and development commands
- Testing approaches
- Build and deployment processes

**Important: Keep this file concise**. Only include information that is relevant for most or all development tasks. Omit specific implementation details that don't affect how agents interact with the codebase.

## Development Commands

This project uses npm scripts for all development tasks:

- **Test all**: `npm test` - Runs all tests in parallel (format, lint, types, unit)
- **Unit tests**: `npm run test:unit` - Run Vitest tests once
- **Watch tests**: `npm run vitest` - Run Vitest in watch mode
- **Lint**: `npm run test:lint` - ESLint with zero warnings allowed
- **Type check**: `npm run test:types` - TypeScript compiler check
- **Format check**: `npm run test:format` - Prettier format validation

**Important**: Use the typescript-lsp MCP to get diagnostics and type information
**Important**: Use the vitest-server MCP to run individual tests.
**Important**: Use the eslint MCP to check for linting errors.

## Project Structure

- **Source**: `src/` - All source code and tests
- **Entry**: `src/index.ts`; public API re-exported via `src/exports/main.exports.ts`, `csv.exports.ts`, `mocks.exports.ts`
- **Core**: `src/clockodo.ts` (Clockodo client), `src/lib/` (api, mappings, requests, etc.)
- **Models**: `src/models/` - TypeScript types and mocks for API entities (entry, customer, project, etc.)
- **Tests**: Co-located with source using `.test.ts` suffix; integration test in `src/integration.test.ts`
- **Configuration**: Uses `@peerigon/configs` for shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier configs

## Code Organization

- SDK methods live on the Clockodo class in `src/clockodo.ts`; API calls go through `src/lib/api.ts`
- Request/response keys are mapped to camelCase in `src/lib/mappings.ts`
- Uses ES module syntax throughout (`.ts` extensions in imports)

## Pulling Updates from Upstream

If user is asking you to pull in updates from the upstream repository, you can do so by following these steps:

### Step 1: Merge Template Updates

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge --strategy-option theirs --no-commit upstream/main
```

This will:

- Prefer template files in conflicts (`--strategy-option theirs`)
- Stage changes without committing (`--no-commit`)

### Step 2: Restore Project Specific Files

Restore project-specific files and changes:

- **package.json**: Restore original dependencies but keep the dependency updates from the upstream repository
- **README.md**: Restore original project documentation
- **AGENTS.md**: Restore project specific instructions and include changes from the upstream repository
- **src/**: Restore project specific source code and include changes from the upstream repository

### Step 3: Verify and Clean Up

1. Run `npm install` to update lockfile
2. Run `npm test` to verify everything works
3. Review `git status` and `git diff --staged` for unexpected changes

### Step 4: Stage Changes

**IMPORTANT**: Stage your changes, but **do not commit**. Ask the user to review the changes first.
